/* =THEME SETUP
-------------------------------------------------------------- */
 
~ Custom Menus 
 
 Kciaotime allows you to change what appears in the menu bar using a simple drag-and-drop options screen. You can access this page by clicking on the wp-admin /Appearance /Menus. You can have many different custom menus and you can assign them to either the primary or secondary menu. Creating a custom menu is very simple.
 These 5 short steps will show you how:
   1. You need to create a menu before you can add your links to it. To do this, enter a name for your menu in the "Menu Name" box and click "Create Menu".
   2. You can now see your list of pages and categories that you have on WordPress. Each page and category has a checkbox next to it. You can select which links you want to add to your menu by selecting the box next to it and then clicking the "Add to Menu" button. (Tip: Want to add individual posts or tags to the menu too? Click the "screen options" button at the very top right of your screen. You'll see the option to select "posts" and "tags" appear.)
   3. Once added, you can no arrange your links in the order you choose. Drag-and-drop your links up and down to change their order.
   4. Did you know you can have drop-down menus? Drag your link to the right underneath another link to make that link appear in a drop-down list below the link above. For example, If I had the page "Contact us" and I wanted the page "Directions" to appear in a drop down list below it, I would place the "Directions" link below the "Contact us" link, and then drag the "Directions" link to the right to indent it.
   5. Now you've finished organising your menu, click the "save menu" button on the right. You now need to assign this custom menu to one of the menus on the theme. The top left box called "theme locations" lists the place you can put your menu. If you want your custom menu to appear in the primary menu spot, select your custom menu from the drop-down box and then click "save". Your custom menu now appears on your website!
    
~ Configure the Slider (Post Slider)
 
  The slideshow is very easy to use. It scrolls through the posts, pages or even custom slides that you've written. You can access the options for the slideshow in the theme options under the "Homepage" tab. Let's take a quick look at what you can do:
  - The first set of options let you choose where you want your slideshow to appear. Our demos show the slideshow only on the homepage but you can display it everywhere if you wanted.
  - Custom post type for slide, the slideshow can used from by default blog, or use post type from plugin installed with input post type in the textarea at theme option.
 
~ Customise the Sidebars & Footer Widget (Widget Areas)
 
  Kciaotime lets you choose what you want to put in your sidebar. Each item in a sidebar is called a widget. The theme puts its own widgets in the sidebars by default so that it doesn't look too empty when you first get it. You can edit the default added widgets or set your own widgets by going to the wp-admin /Appearance/Widgets. To add your own widgets just drag and drop the widgets shown in the middle of the screen) to the sidebars (shown on the right of the screen). Just like the menus, you can drag-and-drop them into any order you want. This theme also comes with some widgets of its own!
Here's a brief summary for some widgets:
  - Contact Info - Display your contact info.
  - Ultimate Posts Widget - Displays a list posts with your own settings. You can add your own filters, include a thumbnail image etc.
  - Social Profiles - Displays icons that link to your profiles on popular social networking sites
 
~ Page Templates
 
  You can choose to display different page templates on your site if you choose! One important one is the full width template page which removes the sidebar(s) from your theme if you want to have a page which lets you put wider content in your website! The other page templates are the sitemap, which lists all the categories and pages in your site; the archive page which lists the most recent posts on your site in a simple list.
A page template can be selected when on the page editing screen. On the right hand side you'll see a box called "page attributes" with the "template" drop-down box inside.
